# Issue

- Add new row and select a value for `City` field from combo. 
- Don't hit `DONE` instead move focus to other field.

#### Actual result:
The City field display `[object]`

#### Expectation:
- The `City` field should display what you select in combo if it is possible or an alternative solution for adding new record.
- As an alternative solution, you must use the grid (not form)
